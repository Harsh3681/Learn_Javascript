"app.use" Method: This method is used to ðŸ‘‰ mount middleware functions

"express.json()" Function: This function is ðŸ‘‰ built-in middleware function
It parses incoming requests to ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰JSON payloads

here ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ JSON Payloads is request with a "JSON body" is ðŸ‘‰received, 
ans ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ express.json() parses the "body" and ðŸ‘‰"converts" into a ðŸ‘‰"JavaScript object."

By using app.use(express.json());, you ensure that this parsing middleware is applied to 
all incoming requests before they reach your ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ route handlers. 
This means any "route" that expects JSON input can access the parsed data directly
ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ via "req.body".

Ex. ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());


app.post('/data', (req, res) => {
 
    const receivedData = req.body; ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ here is main thing happen by --> app.use(express.json());
    console.log(receivedData);

    res.json({ message: "Data received", data: receivedData });
});
