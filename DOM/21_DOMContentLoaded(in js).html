<!-- Explanation:
The DOMContentLoaded event is a crucial part of web development. 
It ensures that your script runs only after the entire HTML document 
has been fully completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, 
images, and subframes to finish loading. 

HTML Structure: A simple HTML structure with a <div> element.
JavaScript Code:
The script waits for the DOMContentLoaded event.
When the event is fired, it changes the text content of the <div> element.
Behavior: The script modifies the DOM as soon as the HTML is completely
 loaded and parsed, without waiting for other resources like images.
